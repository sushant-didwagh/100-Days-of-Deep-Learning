i am so excited to explore the neural network world.
now start from basic and ready to complexity 
intially learning neural network in binary classification.
use churn prediction dataset of banking of predict the customer is active user or not basic of previous activity like credit_score,Geography,Balance,Age,Tenure.

steps are:
1.collect and preprocess dataset
2.transform data values into specific range
3.call keras libarary and its functions
4.create network layes and step functions
5.train network and get weight and bias values
6.finally predict test/your-values is user_is_active or  not

conclusion-
i learn steps of how network layers are created using keras model like #Sequential and what is the parameters activation,cross_validation, loss etc. and how to use this parameters to get high accuray
